## Project: Deploying DeFi Kingdom Clone on Avalanche with Custom EVM Subnet

This project aims to guide you through setting up an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) subnet on Avalanche, defining a native currency, connecting it to Metamask, and deploying basic building blocks for a DeFi Kingdom clone using Solidity and Remix.

## Step-by-Step Guide:

### 1. Set up your EVM subnet:
   - Follow our guide and refer to Avalanche documentation to create a custom EVM subnet on the Avalanche network.
   - Ensure you have the necessary permissions and resources to set up the subnet.

### 2. Define your native currency:
   - Define your own native currency that will serve as the in-game currency for your DeFi Kingdom clone.
   - Consider tokenomics, supply, and distribution mechanisms for your native currency.

### 3. Connect to Metamask:
   - Connect your EVM Subnet to Metamask by following the steps outlined in our guide.
   - Add your subnet as a custom RPC network in Metamask settings.
   - Make sure your EVM subnet is selected as the active network in Metamask.

### 4. Deploy basic building blocks:
   - Use Solidity and Remix to deploy basic building blocks for your game, such as smart contracts for battling, exploring, and trading.
   - Define game rules, liquidity pools, tokens, and more within these contracts.
   - Ensure thorough testing of each deployed contract.
